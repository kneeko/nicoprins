	<p>Port Townsend Art &amp; Frame owners Jeff and Nancy needed a website that would convey their frame shopâ€™s local charm and expertise. I worked with them to design a simple front end that met their needs and informed customers about their many services.</p>
	<p>The business has since been sold to new owners, so this project is no longer live.</p>
