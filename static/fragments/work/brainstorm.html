	<p>I was an instructor for BrainStorm for Educationâ€™s 2011-2012 field course, The Systems that Feed Us. The project aimed to get students actively participating in their own education and working with local professionals. I worked with the students on video-editing, graphic design as well as providing technical consultation for the project.</p>
